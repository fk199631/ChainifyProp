      excerpt: "For our FYP scope, we have selected the primary and secondary property distribution as our Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The primary and secondary uses of property distribution play roles in real estate transactions providing a ground, for incorporating blockchain technology. During the distribution phase blockchain has the potential to transform sale processes by ensuring clear and unchangeable records of property information sales agreements and financial dealings. This not builds trust, between developers and buyers. Also simplifies the intricate tasks of due diligence and contract management. Similarly in secondary property distribution blockchains decentralized ledger can enable secure transfers of property ownership promoting transparency and decreasing the likelihood of activities. Through the utilization of technology stakeholders can enjoy improved efficiency decreased burdens and heightened security across all stages of property transactions ultimately reshaping the dynamics of real estate markets."

    <h1>This section provides a comprehensive overview of our project, encompassing its introduction, objectives, and methodology.</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The real estate industry is traditionally paper-intensive and fraught with inefficiencies, 
        which include prolonged transaction times, susceptibility to fraud, and lack of transparency. 
        This proposal seeks to address these issues by introducing a blockchain-based system for the digitalization of property deeds, 
        leveraging the immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain to reduce fraud, streamline processes, 
        and improve trust among all stakeholders. 
        </p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>

    <p>Our goal is to create a secure, transparent, and efficient system for property deed transactions, 
        mortgages, and building orders. By leveraging the immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain, 
        we aim to reduce fraud, streamline processes, and improve trust among all stakeholders in the real estate sector.
        ​</p>

    <ul class="left-align">
        <li>To design and develop a blockchain platform for the digital management of property deeds​</li>
        <li>To reduce the time and cost associated with property deed transactions, mortgage processing, 
            and issuance of building orders, while maintaining the singularity of the document and securing authenticity the record​</li>
        <li>To increase the security and integrity of real estate transactions</li>
        <li>To provide a transparent and accessible ledger for all stakeholders</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>

    <ul class="left-align">
        <ol type="1">
            <li><strong>Feasibility Study:</strong> Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current real estate transaction process to identify areas of improvement and integration for blockchain technology.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform Design:</strong> Create a blueprint for a blockchain-based digital property deed platform that ensures ease of use while maintaining high security and legal standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Prototype Development - Blockchain:</strong> Develop a working prototype of the blockchain platform to support application functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Prototype Development - Application:</strong> Develop a working prototype of the application to demonstrate functionality and potential benefits.</li>
            <li><strong>System Testing:</strong> Implement a pilot program with select real estate transactions to test and refine the platform.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>

    <h2>Literature Review</h2>

    <h3>Why the Real Estate Industry Needs Modernization?</h3>

        <p>The real estate industry is facing obstacles, such as lack of transparency, inefficiency, fraudulent activities, and a lack of trust among those involved. Traditional methods used for property transactions, mortgage processing, and construction permits tend to be time-consuming, expensive, and vulnerable to manipulation.</p>

        <p>In a traditional property transaction, there are multiple steps involved, including property search, negotiation, due diligence, documentation, and closing. Each step can take a considerable amount of time, leading to delays in completing the transaction. Manual paperwork is heavily relied upon, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors, further exacerbating the inefficiency.</p>

        <p>Additionally, due diligence prior to a transaction requires stakeholders to spend time accessing and verifying information. Every document copy needs to be verified with the source to ensure authenticity, which can be a cumbersome process.</p>

        <p>These challenges highlight the importance of finding solutions to modernize and secure real estate operations.</p>

    <h3>How Blockchain Technology Can Solve Inefficiencies in the Real Estate Market</h3>

        <p>Blockchain technology has emerged as a solution to these issues. Studies have shown its benefits in simplifying transactions and enhancing security within the real estate market. Blockchain can improve transparency, efficiency, and reduce fraudulent activities. By utilizing blockchain, real estate transactions can become more reliable and transparent.</p>

        <p>Our team aims to leverage blockchain technology to create a platform that handles property deeds, mortgages, and building orders digitally. This decentralized approach will establish a reliable and transparent system for real estate transactions, removing intermediaries and enabling peer-to-peer interactions.</p>

        <p>Despite its advantages, challenges such as regulatory compliance and security protocols need to be addressed when implementing blockchain technology in real estate.</p>

    <h3>Choice of Blockchain Platforms</h3>

        <p>After considering various factors, including the need for strong governance and control over property deeds, our team has chosen Hyperledger as the preferred blockchain platform. Hyperledger's permissioned blockchain model allows for controlled transparency and prioritizes efficiency and immutability.</p>

        <p>Hyperledger Fabric and Besu offer flexibility in terms of smart contract development and execution, making them suitable for our project's requirements. These platforms support various programming languages commonly used in the Information Technology industry, ensuring ease of development and maintenance.</p>

        <p>In addition to smart contract support, Hyperledger offers features such as verifiable credential, decentralized identity, and multi-chain interoperability, further enhancing the capabilities of our project.</p>
